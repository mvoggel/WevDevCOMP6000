            <p class="intro">Outside the forest, there lived a curious fox named Felix. One day Felix was curled up, laying around feeling low, like something was missing. 
            </p>
            <p>Something wakes him up, and makes him feel an all-too-familiar feeling... </p>

                As Felix steps under the tree cover, the world transforms around him. He had forgotten about the forest for a moment, and was reminded 
                of the sparkle of the light on the leaves, the earth beneath his feet, the smell of all the trees and foliage. He runs around 
                in joy, watch him go!
